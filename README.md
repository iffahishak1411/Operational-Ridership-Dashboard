# Operational Ridership Dashboard (Power BI)

---

## 🌟 Overview
This project is a **Power BI dashboard** developed to monitor and analyse operational ridership across various routes for better decision-making in the Planning & Strategy department.  

It provides a **centralised view of ridership trends, average ridership, total ridership and operational Key Performance Indicatiors (KPIs)** to support data-driven decisions.

## 🔒 Confidentiality Note
All data in this dashboard has been **recreated or anonymised to protect company confidentiality**. This sample only reflects the data logic and structure used in the actual project.

---

## 🛑 Problem Statement
The department faced several challenges in operational reporting:  

- **Inefficient reporting process**: Multiple manual spreadsheets and fragmented data sources.  
- **High risk of human error**: Manual calculations led to inconsistencies.  
- **Limited analytical depth**: Existing reports were mostly static and did not allow detailed exploration of trends or KPIs. 

---

## 💡 Solution
To address these issues, a **centralised Power BI dashboard** was developed to:  

- Automate data consolidation from multiple sources.  
- Provide **interactive visualisations** for operational KPIs.  
- Allow **real-time monitoring** of ridership trends and peak hours.  
- Enhance decision-making for planning, scheduling and resource allocation.

## 🛠 Tools & Technology
- **Power BI Desktop & Power BI Service** 🖥️  
- **Power Query**: Data extraction and transformation  
- **Excel**: Data preprocessing, including data cleaning and data transformation
- **DAX**: Custom measures for KPIs

## 🏗 Project Walkthrough (Step-by-Step)
1. **Data Collection & Cleaning**  
   - Extract ridership data from internal operational databases (SQL).  
   - Clean and preprocess data in Excel.  
   - Handle missing values and data inconsistencies.

2. **Data Modeling**  
   - Import cleaned data into Power BI.  
   - Define relationships between tables.  
   - Create calculated columns and measures using **DAX**.

3. **Dashboard Design**  
   - Design interactive visuals (bar charts, line charts, heatmaps).  
   - Implement filters for routes, time periods, and operational categories.  

4. **Testing & Validation**  
   - Verify calculations match source data.  
   - Validate dashboard accuracy with stakeholders.

5. **Deployment**  
   - Publish to Power BI Service.  
   - Enable scheduled data refresh for automated updates.
